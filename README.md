## Insight and Recommendations
- Adding up the number of title positions, there is going to be about 88,314 retirement eligible employees and the number of roles that will need to be filled as the silver tsunami begins.
- The roles that will need to be filled is far less than the number of mentorship eligible senior employees.
- Possible recommendations include: 1) expanding the mentorship program within a 5 year range to have more mentors 2) Allowing senior employees to work from home, which would allow for them to work additional years and allowing  more time build up the workforce. 3) Further analysis should also look at gender and cultural diversity of the workforce, looking at need of hiring well-diverse workforce.
